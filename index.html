// A property has no ()

// PRINTING STUFF

	console.log("Hello, World");

	document.write("Hello, World"); // this is the source code 

// VARIABLES
// string - letters, numbers and other stuff you can make with your keyboard. Strings are for PEOPLE. Must be inside of either '' or "". Sublime codes them yellow. A string is a 'data type'.

// integers - number with no decimal point

	console.log(.2 + .1); // this equals .3000000000000004 (or so) - this could be an interview type of question - it's a 'gotcha'
